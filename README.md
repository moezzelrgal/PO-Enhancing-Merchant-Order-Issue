## Introduction
This repository contains the analysis and proposed solution for improving the **merchant order issue resolution process**. The goal is to enable efficient, transparent, and automated tracking, escalation, and resolution of delivery-related complaints.

---

## Case Study Background

You’re the Product Owner for the Merchant Portal at a fast-growing fulfillment and logistics startup.

**Merchant Profile:**
- **Size:** Small to mid-sized e-commerce brands and local retailers.
- **Primary Market:** Egypt and Saudi Arabia.
- **Common Verticals:** Fashion & accessories, cosmetics, electronics.
- **Order Volumes:** 100 to 1,000 orders/month per merchant.
- **Sales Channels:** Shopify, Instagram, Facebook.

**Current Problem:**
Merchants currently report order issues (e.g., delays, damage, incorrect items) via phone or email to account managers or support teams. This process is slow, inconsistent, and lacks transparency. Merchants have no visibility into issue status within the portal and are under pressure to update their own customers on social platforms.

**Objective:**
Build or integrate an efficient and transparent in-portal solution that:
- Allows merchants to log and track issues.
- Provides real-time notifications and updates.
- Integrates with mobile tools (e.g., WhatsApp, SMS).
- Supports internal SLA management and escalation.

**Considerations:**
- Go beyond ticketing — consider mobile-first experiences.
- Decide whether to **build in-house** or **integrate with SaaS**.
- Recommend the most viable approach.

- Structured tools for tracking and escalating delivery complaints in real time.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

| KPI                          | Definition                     | Target                    |

## Build vs. Integrate Recommendation

| Approach       | Time to Market | Initial Cost | Annual Cost | Notes                        |
|----------------|----------------|--------------|-------------|------------------------------|
| Integrate (SaaS) | 4–8 weeks     | $5K–$10K     | $15K–$30K   | Fast, scalable               |
| Build In-House  | 24–52 weeks    | $40K–$60K    | $70K–$140K  | Custom, but expensive        |

**Recommendation:** Use SaaS (e.g., Zendesk, Freshdesk) to launch faster and prioritize logistics innovation.
