## Introduction
This repository contains the analysis and proposed solution for improving the merchant order issue resolution process. The goal is to enable efficient, transparent, and automated tracking, escalation, and resolution of delivery-related complaints.

---

## Gap Analysis
The current system lacks:
- Structured tools for tracking and escalating delivery complaints in real time.
- Transparency and automation in issue resolution.
- Mature processes for efficient handling of merchant issues.

Root cause: absence of integrated tools and workflows.

---

## Proposed Features

### Feature 1: Integrated Merchant Issue Resolution Hub (In-Portal & Mobile-Enabled)
- Centralized issue logging and tracking dashboard.
- Real-time status updates.
- Mobile notifications (SMS/WhatsApp).

### Feature 2: Smart Workflow Automation & Communication Gateway
- Automated ticketing with SLA tracking and escalation.
- Two-way communication via SMS/WhatsApp.
- Backend triage and prioritization tools.

---

## User Stories

### Feature 1: Merchant Portal
- **Submit a New Issue:** Merchants can report issues with autogenerated Issue IDs.
- **Track Issues:** Merchants view all active/resolved issues in a sortable dashboard.
- **Receive Notifications:** Merchants get instant SMS/WhatsApp alerts when issues are resolved.

### Feature 2: Support Agent Tools
- **View and Triage Issues:** Centralized queue with filters.
- **Change and Sync Status:** Update issue status reflected in merchant portal with notifications.
- **SLA-Based Auto Escalation:** Automatic escalation of unresolved issues beyond SLA.

## Build vs. Integrate Recommendation

| Approach       | Time to Market  | Initial Cost    | Annual Cost       | Comments                              |
|----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Integrate (SaaS) | 4–8 weeks       | $5,000–$10,000  | $15,000–$30,000   | Faster deployment, lower cost       |
| Build In-House  | 24–52 weeks     | $40,000–$60,000 | $70,000–$140,000  | Longer development, higher cost     |

**Recommendation:** Integrate with platforms like Zendesk or Freshdesk to accelerate deployment and focus on core logistics innovation.
